# AGAI – AI-Powered Journal and Companion (Showcase)

**AGAI** is a play on words: combining “aga” (a friendly Turkish address) and **AI**.  
It’s designed to be more than just a chatbot — AGAI is your digital friend, emotional support system, and personal journal combined.

## 🧠 Project Vision

AGAI aims to create a personal space where users can chat with an AI that feels like a **psychologist, friend, or mentor** — depending on their needs. After each conversation, users can convert the chat into a diary entry and keep it stored safely.  
It merges emotional support and digital journaling in a single elegant system.
